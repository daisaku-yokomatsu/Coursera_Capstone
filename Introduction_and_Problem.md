## Introduction

I recently heard the news that New York City's population is declining due to the COVID-19 epidemic. According to the news, more and more people are moving to the suburbs, where there is less need to commute to work and less events to enjoy, and where housing costs are lower.
I'm sure that as vaccination progresses and infections decrease, tourists will return to the area.
However,in the business world, with the ease of online meetings, the number of people traveling to New York will not return to what it was before.

My guess is that the number of people make business trip to New York may decrease, but their stay will be longer than before. The need for work that cannot be completed in online meetings or doing things together in the same place will not disappear, in fact, I think it will become more prominent.

## Business Problem 

Coursera's Capstone project is looking at the New York and Toronto areas.
We experienced the problem of clustering analysis with K-means using data from Foursquare.
For my final assignment for Capsotne, I decided to define the following problem based on this hands-on experience:.

Examine the distribution of rental apartments and supermarkets needed by business travelers staying in New York City for a somewhat longer period of time, based on subway stations. Analyze the situation of stations with more or less apartments and supermarkets.

If the business traveler is going to stay for a rather long period of time, there may be three requirements that the business traveler needs. They want good access to public transportation; they want apartments that require little maintenance; and they want supermarkets that are close by and convenient for shopping.

As the population declines, real estate prices often fall. This is an opportunity for investors to buy an apartment for investment or to buy a building and renovate it. It would be worthwhile for investors to know the situation of New York as a whole in order to look for investment targets. In addition, I myself would like to use this analysis to rent a good property at a low cost when I go to New York for business in the future.
